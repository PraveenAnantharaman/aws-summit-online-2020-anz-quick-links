# Abstract

Supercharged customer experience with AWS Amplify, Amazon Pinpoint, and Amazon Personalize

In this session, we explore how to leverage data effectively when building engaging web applications like an ecommerce website. We explore how we can easily instrument and send real-time analytics to the backend through the use of AWS Amplify and how we can understand our customers and their personalised preferences with Amazon Pinpoint. Finally, we look at how to integrate Amazon Personalize to provide a real-time recommendation engine.
