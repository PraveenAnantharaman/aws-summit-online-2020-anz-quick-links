# Abstract

AI/ML state of the nation (Level 200)

As we enter a new decade, we take a brief look back at the impact of AI/ML for our customers and outline the areas we expect to be important in the future. We also cover some of the services, patterns, and use cases that have enabled our customers to rapidly adopt AI/ML into their organisations as well as the newer services and features now available for customers to use.
