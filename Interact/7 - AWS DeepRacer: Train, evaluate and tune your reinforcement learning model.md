# Abstract

AWS DeepRacer: Train, evaluate, and tune your reinforcement learning model (Level 300)

In this session, we introduce the basics of reinforcement learning and show you how to apply it to train your own autonomous vehicle models. You also learn how to test them in a virtual car racing scenario powered by AWS DeepRacer. Learn about the single-car time-trial format and the dual-car head-to-head racing challenges in the AWS DeepRacer 3D racing simulator. By the end of this session, you will be able to participate in the AWS DeepRacer League, where you can compete for prizes and meet other machine learning enthusiasts.
