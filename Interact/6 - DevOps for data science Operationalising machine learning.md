# Abstract

DevOps for data science: Operationalising machine learning (Level 400)

Organisations are recognising the importance of cross-functional expertise and efficient tooling when bringing AI-driven products to market. In this session, learn how to build an end-to-end pipeline for continuous delivery of ML models. Also learn how to automate MLOps with Amazon SageMaker and serverless workflows to build, deploy, and monitor models at scale to maximise the business value to your organisation.
