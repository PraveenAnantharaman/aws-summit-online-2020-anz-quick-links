# Abstract

Unlabelled data and the rise of reinforcement learning (Level 400)

Reinforcement learning (RL) has captured headlines with exceptional feats in the game industry, and we have also seen some amazing RL applications in robotics. It can also be applied whenever you have a problem that requires constant decisions in an uncertain environment. In this session, you learn the types of problems that RL is suitable for, hear about how you can tap into the power of RL using AWS services, and learn some of the best practices and pitfalls of using RL.
