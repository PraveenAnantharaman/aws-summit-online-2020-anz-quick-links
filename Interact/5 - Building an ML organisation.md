# Abstract

Building an ML organisation (Level 300)

The advent of AI/ML is reshaping the enterprise and opening new challenges and opportunities. Building an ML-powered organisation requires specific considerations to be successful and avoid the traps of incorrect investment, team structure, unrealistic expectations, and little gains. Get it right and you can redefine the competitive landscape and positively impact the bottom line.
