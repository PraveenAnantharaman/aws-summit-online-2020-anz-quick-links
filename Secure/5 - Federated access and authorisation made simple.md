# Abstract

Federated access and authorisation made simple (Level 200)

In this session, learn how to implement attribute-based access control with role-based access control. We discuss how you can use this strategy to ensure that people have the right access to the things they need in their role, and we show you how to simplify their IAM policies in the process. Also learn how automation can deliver the consistency of access and authorisation, and how you can apply this to your environment.
