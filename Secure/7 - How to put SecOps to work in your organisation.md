# Abstract

How to put SecOps to work in your organisation (Level 200)

Open Universities Australia (OUA) migrated their core business systems to AWS in 2014 and have continued to optimise their environment on AWS. Leveraging AWS tools, OUA have automated responses to security events, limiting intervention of engineering staff, and enabling secure self-service tasks to simplify access to secure systems. In this session, OUA covers what worked, what didn't, and what they learned along the way.
