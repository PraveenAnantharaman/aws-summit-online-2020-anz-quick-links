# Abstract

How Amazon's culture affects incident management at AWS (Level 200)

In large decentralised organisations like AWS, critical processes like incident management can be difficult to define, make consistent, and continuously improve. The urgency of a customer-impacting incident changes the way you operate and how you communicate with other teams. In this session, we discuss the aspects of Amazonâ€™s culture that have helped scale our incident management process. We also share our learnings and provide practical tips on how culture drives more effective operational practices.
