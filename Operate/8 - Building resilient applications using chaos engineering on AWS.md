# Abstract

Building resilient applications using chaos engineering on AWS (Level 200)

With the wide adoption of microservices and large-scale distributed systems, architectures have grown increasingly complex, making them hard to debug and test, and increasing the risk of outages. Fortunately, chaos engineering reveals failures before they become outages. In this session, we introduce chaos engineering and show you how to start practicing it on AWS. We walk through the tools and methods you can use to inject failures into your architecture and make them more resilient to failure.
