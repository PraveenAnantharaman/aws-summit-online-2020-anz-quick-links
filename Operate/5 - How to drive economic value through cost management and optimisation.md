# Abstract

How to drive economic value through cost management and optimisation (Level 200)

The economics of the cloud are compelling, but customers need to take action and put governance in place to realise its full benefits. In this session, we discuss how to drive commercial and technical optimisation through automation, tagging, and tooling in order to achieve cost reduction. We also cover the Savings Plans pricing model in depth and share proven methods that accelerate cost optimisation. This session is suitable for both new and existing customers who are interested in gaining additional control of their cloud spend.
