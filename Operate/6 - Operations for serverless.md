# Abstract

Operations for serverless (Level 300)

Traditional operations are designed for long living infrastructure, low to medium velocity of changes, and pre-defined scale, but serverless applications may have different requirements. Applications are now being broken into hundreds of micro-services and can use multiple data sources, so applying the traditional practices of monitoring, service configuration, and change control will need to evolve. In this session, we will outline top challenges to operate serverless applications on AWS and demonstrate key operations focused on design patterns.
