# Abstract

How to create an environment that accelerates transformation and unlocks innovation (Level 200)

Transformation is a common theme for enterprises adopting the cloud. But in order to realise the benefits that the cloud has to offer, your workforce needs the type of skills and experience that take time to build. In this session, learn what you can do to provide your workforce with an environment that enables transformation, and discover how other organisations have worked with the AWS Skills Guild to produce an agile and innovative community of builders to accelerate their journey to cloud.

Speaker: Brian Kozan
AWS Skills Guild Delivery Lead, APAC
