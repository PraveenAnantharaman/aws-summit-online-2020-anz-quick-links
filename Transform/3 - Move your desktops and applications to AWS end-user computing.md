# Abstract

Move your desktops and applications to AWS end-user computing (Level 200)

Designed for companies that have contingent workers, remote offices or frequent M&A, this session will help you understand how Amazon has taken on the challenge of providing virtual desktops to over 25K users around the world. Freed from the challenges of on-prem VDI solutions, Amazon IT uses Amazon WorkSpaces to quickly provision desktops in minutes supported by just two engineers - saving over \$17M annually. This session will provide an overview of the WorkSpaces service, the Amazon IT use cases in production, and the architectural approach they chose to service 25K users. Learn why and how Amazon WorkSpaces has become “the de facto model for onboarding new remote employees, contract workers, and subsidiaries.”
