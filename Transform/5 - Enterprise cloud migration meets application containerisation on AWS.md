# Abstract

Enterprise cloud migration meets application containerisation on AWS (Level 300)

In this session, learn how to build your application migration framework and pipelines centering on containerisation. We show you how to assess and qualify your applications, build and refine your landing zones, create specific security baselines, and create migration pipelines leveraging Amazon ECR and Amazon EKS, two services that are part of the AWS container management portfolio.
