# Abstract

Building secure multi-tenant .NET core apps on AWS (Level 400)

In this developer focused session, we dive into .NET core code and learn how to integrate your application’s security context into Amazon Cognito. You will learn how .NET concepts like claim based identity and thread security context seamlessly interact with AWS. When confronted with a software bug, you want to avoid leaking sensitive data. You will learn how to partition data at infrastructure level, apply a policy based on user’s tenancy, and create multiple layers of security to reduce the blast radius of a security breach.
