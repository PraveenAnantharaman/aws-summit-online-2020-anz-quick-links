# Abstract

The art of the state: Coordinating services using AWS Step Functions (Level 200)

Microservice architectures give us increased agility and scale, but as they grow, they can become complicated to coordinate and debug. In this session, we review common service coordination patterns and how AWS Step Functions can help us quickly build fully managed and resilient workflows powered by easy-to-understand state machines.

Speaker: Gabe Hollombe
Senior Developer Advocate
