# Abstract

Application integration patterns for microservices: Fan-out strategies (Level 200)

As microservices architecture become more popular, customers need a framework of patterns to help them identify and use AWS to deploy their workloads without managing servers or operating systems. In this session, we describe reusable serverless patterns with a focus on the messaging architecture. For each pattern, we provide operational, security, and reliability best practices and discuss potential challenges. We also demonstrate the implementation of some of the patterns in a reference solution. Learn how to recognise services and applications for serverless architectures in your own organisation.
