# Abstract

Kubernetes GitOps on AWS

GitOps is an approach where infrastructure as code lives alongside your application in the same Git repository, and any changes are automatically deployed when they’re merged there. This session demonstrates how to implement this approach for AWS-managed backend resources together with front-end services running on Kubernetes out of the same Git repository. You learn how AWS resources are deployed and managed in an automated way and deployed on Kubernetes via Flux. If you’re a developer or operational team member looking for ways to leverage AWS with Kubernetes and Amazon EKS to build and run applications in a simpler and cohesive Git-driven experience, this is the session for you.
