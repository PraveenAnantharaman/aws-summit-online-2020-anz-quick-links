# Abstract

Building serverless applications with AWS Amplify (Level 400)

Since it was released in 2017 as a JavaScript library, AWS Amplify has become a great way to build, provision, and deploy web and mobile serverless applications on AWS. In this session, we explore what you can do with AWS Amplify. We provide examples of how to build application APIs, and we show you how to add advanced capabilities like AI/ML to your application. We also discuss best practices around developer tooling and workflow as well as CI/CD orchestration using the Amplify console.
