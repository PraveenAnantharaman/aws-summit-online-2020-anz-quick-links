# Abstract

Purpose-built databases for modern applications (Level 300)

Seldom can one database fit the needs of multiple distinct use cases. The days of the one-size-fits-all monolithic database are behind us, and developers are building highly distributed applications using many purpose-built databases. The world is changing, and the categories of databases continue to grow. We are increasingly seeing customers wanting to build Internet-scale applications that require diverse data models. In response to these needs, developers now have the choice of relational, key-value, wide column, document, in-memory, graph, time-series, and ledger databases. Each solves a specific problem or group of problems. Come learn about AWS purpose-built databases that meet the scale, performance, and manageability requirements of modern applications.
