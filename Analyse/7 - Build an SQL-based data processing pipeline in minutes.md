# Abstract

Build an SQL-based data processing pipeline in minutes (Level 300)

Organisations rely on a huge amount of data and smart analytics to speed up their decision-making processes. However, data processing is often a complex and lengthy undertaking. In this session, we introduce one of the quickest ways to prepare your data for analysis without the need to program. We demonstrate how to create a SQL-based data flow in a few minutes by leveraging your understanding of the data, not the underlying Spark technology.
