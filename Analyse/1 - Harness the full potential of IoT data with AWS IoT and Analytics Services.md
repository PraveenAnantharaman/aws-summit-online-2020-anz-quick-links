# Abstract

Harness the full potential of IoT data with AWS IoT and Analytics Services (Level 300)

If you knew the state of everything and could reason on top of that data, what problems could you solve? IoT data helps companies shift how they do business, improve product innovation, and impact customer experience. In this session, learn how AWS IoT helps organisations operate more intelligently by ingesting data from industrial and consumer products and modeling these assets using AWS IoT SiteWise. Also learn how to use analytics services, such as AWS Lake Formation, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon QuickSight, to unlock value from IoT data, gain insights, and drive innovation.
