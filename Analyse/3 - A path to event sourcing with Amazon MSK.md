# Abstract

A path to event sourcing with Amazon MSK (Level 300)

Event sourcing is an exciting pattern for thinking differently about how to process and store data. With Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK), itâ€™s now even easier for development teams to run and operate applications that are built around event sourcing patterns. In this session, we demonstrate a Java-based personal banking website that uses Amazon MSK, AWS Fargate, and Amazon Elasticsearch Service (Amazon ES) to process data using event sourcing with eventual consistency. We explore the code and review some of the operational characteristics in the AWS Management Console.
