# Abstract

Mastering your data journey one step at a time (Level 200)

You’ve decided to move your data to the cloud, but how do you do that while allowing the right people across your business to access it? This session shows how you can migrate your data and build a single secure data lake with the right permissions for different users. Once you’ve made the data available, we show you how to gradually leverage higher-level AWS services to build different use cases for data exploration. We also show you how it is possible to leverage machine learning to obtain valuable business insights along the way.
