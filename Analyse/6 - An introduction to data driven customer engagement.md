# Abstract

An introduction to data driven customer engagement (Level 100)

A customer engagement strategy is vital to business performance, and using AWS can help you create a unique experience for customers engaging with your organisation. This session provides an overview of the AWS customer experience services. We show you how using unique customer attributes and accessing AI/ML services enable you to move beyond traditional skills-based routing. Discover how to create a personalised, predictive environment, one where customers are better understood and can quickly access the answers and information they need.
