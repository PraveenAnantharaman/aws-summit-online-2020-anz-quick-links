# Abstract

Activating data as a strategic asset (Level 100)

The promise of the data-driven organisation is to leverage democratised data platforms infused with ML to drive better decision making, build better products, and deliver personalised customer experiences. While the latest technologies and industry-leading skills are key components of any data, analytics, and AI strategy, many organisations are not addressing the organisational and cultural challenges of becoming data-driven.
